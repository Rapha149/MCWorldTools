Useful tools for Minecraft worlds such as removing unused chunks and finding blocks, command blocks or entities.  
Tested from `1.7.10` up to `1.18.1`.

## Installation
```pip install mcworldtools```

## Usage
You can simply run the command `mcworldtools` in a Minecraft world folder.
If you don't want to run the command in that folder, you can also pass it to the script as the first argument. For example:  
```mcworldtools my_minecraft_world```

The script will tell you the name of your Minecraft world and - if possible, it may not be in older versions - the Minecraft version of your world.  
After that you can choose which tool you want to use by stating the number of the tool.

### Warning
Do **NOT** use these tools for a world that is currently opened (i.e. in Minecraft Singleplayer or by a Minecraft server).
Doing so may lead to unintended consequences. I do NOT take any responsibility for your Minecraft world if you do that.
